To run the app follow the steps in this link to set up your React Native environment locally (check the **React Native CLI Quickstart**):

Once you have your environment set up, open Android Studio and close any open projects. Click on the three dots and then click on Virtual Device Manager. Select on the AVD you want to run the app on and click on the play triange to _"launch this AVD in the emulator"_.
Then clone this git repo and open cmd terminal and follow below steps:
```html

npm start
```
Open a second cmd terminal and follow below steps:

**Why hire me?**

_It's one week prior to finals at CMU so I couldn't spend more than 30 hours on this project. I am pretty comfortable with backend development, especially in Java, but I tried React Native for the first time in my life. Keeping in consideration that this project was accomplished in under 30 hours, I think it shows promise that I can learn and adapt quickly. :)_
